# Algorithm Visualizer Project 
The goal of this proyect is to make sorting algorithms easier to understand trough visual representation.
Each Algorithm is animated and provides a brief explanation of how it works. 
Later, there is more information about each one.

## Bubble Sort

- The bars change colors and are swapped following the Bubble Sort Algorithm logic

## Merge Sort

- A binary tree is formed to represent the Merge Sort Algorithm workflow

## Heap Sort

- The array and its binary tree representation show how the Heap Sort Algorithm works
